    <h1>Experience:</h1>


    <p> I am currently studying neuroscience and chemistry with a splash of coding
        to compliment my strengths. I'm more interested in the integration of technology
        to the human itself, or rather the implmentation of the brain to technology.
    </p>

    <p>Much is to be researched and my expertise in neuroscience and chemistry can guide
        the journey to making new discoveries in these fields.
    </p>

        <blockquote>
        Researchers have created synthetic human embryos using stem cells that 
        do not require sperm and ova. This is important in learning more about genetic disorders and human development.

<p>In the summer of 2023, I studied abroad in Rome during July-August! Our stay was in the Trastevere district.</p>

    During my time at AUR, I stuided Roman Archeology and Italian culture.
    I believe that archeology has many similarities 
    with neuroscience and chemistry.

<!--    Although not seemingly close in subjects, the intersection 
    opens up new subfields in both subjects such as neuroarcheology or 
    using chemistry to determine artifact residue from several thousand years ago. -->

<p>I've completed courses in calculus, general chemistry, organic chemistry I & II, neuroscience
    courses among many others. Needless to say, I have survived.
